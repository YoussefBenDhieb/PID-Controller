# CarND-Controls-PID

Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program - Term 2 - Project 4

## Implementation
---
#### Manual Tuning
When I first implemented the Controller, I started with a Proportional controller. The car was oscillating which was expected. I fine tuned the P controller to obtain the lowest oscillations I can.
Then, I added a derivative controller and the car started to follow the road. I fine tuned it and did the same with the integral controller.

#### Tuning with a twiddle
After the manual tuning of the controller, the car started fllowin the road but the results were not convincing. Hence I added a twiddle  function to automaticly fine tune the controller. The function was implemented as presented in the lectures.
#### Final results
After a lot of laps the car had a better behaviour following the road thanks to the twiddle. However, we could get better results with a pid controller if we use a kinematic or dynamic model and do the frequency domain analisys.

  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
* [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets)
  * Run either `./install-mac.sh` or `./install-ubuntu.sh`.
  * If you install from source, checkout to commit `e94b6e1`, i.e.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets 
    cd uWebSockets
    git checkout e94b6e1
    ```
    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.

There's an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3)
